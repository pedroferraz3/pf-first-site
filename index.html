    <p><i>Curious by nature, creative by design. Explore the intersection of architecture, photography, and UX.</i></p>
    
    <p>Hey there â€” I am Pedro. I am a UX/UI designer who started out in architecture, developed a deep love for photography, and somehow found the perfect balance between structure and creativity in digital design. Outside of work, I am probably doing hot yoga, organizing a volleyball game, or planning my next travel adventure. Explore my work to see how curiosity, empathy, and design come together to shape impactful solutions.</p>
