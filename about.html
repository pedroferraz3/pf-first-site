    <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
    <p>With a foundation in <a href="#Architecture">architecture</a>, a refined eye through photography, and a growing expertise in UX/UI design, I bring a creative, user-centered mindset to every project. My experience across these disciplines has shaped how I approach design—balancing structure and storytelling, form and function. I thrive on solving complex problems with thoughtful solutions that elevate the user experience and create meaningful digital interactions.</p>
        
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>My educational journey reflects a deep curiosity and a drive to constantly evolve as a designer and problem solver. I hold a Bachelor's degree in <strong>Architecture and Urban Planning</strong> from Mackenzie University (2010), which laid the foundation for my structured, systems-thinking approach. Shortly after, I pursued a <strong>Diploma in Photography</strong> from the International Institute of Photography (2011), sharpening my visual intuition and storytelling skills. Most recently, I have expanded my expertise into human-centered design by completing a <strong>UX/UI Design Certificate</strong> at BCIT (2025). Along the way, I have continued to explore complementary areas through courses in renewable energy, pocket parks and landscaping, furnishing projects, graphic design, visual enhancement, and symbolic architecture. This interdisciplinary path has not only enriched my creative perspective but also reinforced my commitment to lifelong learning and designing with intention across scales and mediums.</p>
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    Did I tell you I speak four languages? <strong>Portuguese, Spanish, English, and French</strong>. Being multilingual is not just about words, it is about understanding people, cultures, and perspectives. It is a big part of how I connect with users and teams, and it reflects my curiosity and love of learning. This ability to shift between languages helps me adapt quickly, communicate clearly, and design with empathy for diverse audiences around the world.
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>Technology has always been a key ally in how I approach design and problem solving. I am comfortable moving across a wide range of platforms, choosing the right tools to reach goals efficiently and overcome challenges with agility. My experience spans from architectural software like <strong>Revit, AutoCAD, Vectorworks, and SketchUp,</strong> to creative tools such as <strong>Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Camera Raw</strong>. I also rely on <strong>Figma and Miro</strong> for collaborative UX and UI design work and Microsoft Office for clear communication and documentation. Whether I am designing a user interface or fine tuning architectural layouts, I use technology as a flexible extension of my creative process.</p>
    <h3>What do I do when not working?</h3>
    <p>When I am not designing or solving user problems, you can probably find me playing beach volleyball, discovering new flavours (yes, I am a total food lover), or brewing the perfect cup of coffee. Music keeps my brain buzzing, and I have a growing jungle of plants that bring a little calm to my workspace. I am also a huge fan of indie films and film festivals, stories told through a different lens inspire me endlessly. Oddly, I am especially drawn to scenes where cities and constructions are slowly reclaimed by nature there is something poetic about the contrast.</p>
    <h3>My start with Architecture</h3>
    <p><a name="Architecture">Architecture</a> is where I first learned that design is more than aesthetics—it is strategy, structure, and a way to shape how people experience the world. Many of the concepts I use today in UX—like user flow, hierarchy, and spatial logic—have their roots in architectural thinking. With over seven years of experience as an architect and project manager, I led multidisciplinary teams, coordinated complex projects, and worked closely with clients to bring ideas to life. My interest in design began there, driven by the belief that good design has the power to influence behavior, improve daily life, and spark meaningful change. That same belief guides how I approach digital design today.</p>
